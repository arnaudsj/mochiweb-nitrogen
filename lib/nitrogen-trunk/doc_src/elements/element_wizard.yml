title: Wizard Element
see_also:   base, panel

description: >
  The wizard element makes a multi-step wizard.<br>
  The wizard MUST be named with an id (unlike most controls which can have optional id's).
  <br>
  The wizard works by rendering ALL steps at the time the wizard is first displayed,
  and then hiding or showing the correct step using Javascript/CSS.
  <br>
  The wizard displays a title, and 'Back', 'Next', and 'Finish' buttons, one set at the top of the wizard,
  another set at the bottom. These title and buttons can be changed or hidden in CSS using 
  'wizard_title', 'wizard_buttons_top', and 'wizard_buttons_bottom' classes, respectively.
